# Investigating internal migration with network analysis and latent space representations: An application to Turkey



The reproducibility files for our analysis investigating the internal migration between the Turkish cities from 2008 to 2020.

**input** folder contains the input data: migration numbers between cities and some metadata about the cities.

**I.ipynb** contains the code for learning latent representations.

**II.R** contains the code for computing the reciprocity and structural balance.

**III.ipynb** contains the code for other findings and visualizations presented in the paper.

**input** folder contains the results generated as part of the analysis, using the three code files.
