# Investigating internal migration with network analysis and latent space representations: An application to Turkey



The reproducibility files for our analysis investigating the internal migration between the Turkish cities from 2008 to 2020.

**input** folder contains the input data: migration numbers between cities and some metadata about the cities.

**I.ipynb** contains the code for learning latent representations.

**II.R** contains the code for computing the reciprocity and structural balance.

**III.ipynb** contains the code for other findings and visualizations presented in the paper.

**input** folder contains the results generated as part of the analysis, using the three code files.


The original migration data (reproduced in the file "migration.csv") may be obtained from https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en. The data may be generated by choosing "In (Out) Migration Across Provinces" and following the prompts to select all cities except for "Foreign Country". Due to the data size limits, not all years can be selected at once. You may need to download data in portions based on years.
